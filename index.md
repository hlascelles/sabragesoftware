# ToodleTask

ToodleTask is a very small, lightweight app for quickly entering tasks into [ToodleDo][toodledo]. 
From just 
one press on the homescreen, you can begin typing immediately. Defaults values can be set for the 
tasks, and they will be uploaded at once, or when an internet connection becomes available. Note, 
this app is not standalone - it is for use with the (free) [ToodleDo][toodledo] Task List web application.

It was written for my own use to make it very easy to add tasks. I was frustrated by all the other 
apps I tried that required up to 4 button presses to open a new task window, and then another one 
to focus the cursor in the "title" box to make the keyboard appear.

Following the GTD methodology, you can use this to spend less time following fiddly processes to 
enter tasks / write down the name of a tune you've just heard / record an idea, and more time 
enjoying a beer with the person sitting opposite you (who hates it when you've got your head 
down tapping away enough as it is...)
